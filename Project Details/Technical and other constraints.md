# Technical and other constraints

## Technical constraints

</br>

- Python and certain version of set of packages will be used for the project.

</br>

- Some team members have no experience in the background physics knowledge and certain toolkits used and may need some time to learn about it.  

</br>

- HPC clusters will be needed for generating the dataset.

</br>

- Authorization of remote access to HPC will be needed for the project.

</br>

- The team basically works online so that collaborating tools (Slack, Zoom, Confluence, Github, etc.) will be mainly used for communication.

</br>

## Time constraints

</br>

- The project requires some possible outputs within the limited time of one semester.

</br>

- Our project is possibly a part of research of our client and our activities may need to meet both agenda of TechLauncher course requirements and our client's academic activities (deadlines of call for conferences or papers).
