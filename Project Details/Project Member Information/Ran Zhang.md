I would like to contribute role as

- Physics model developer

- Tester

As a Physics model develper/PhiFlow Developer

I majored in physics during my undergraduate period, I am familiar with numerical analysis tools for PDE and ODE, and have experience in numerical computing.

As a Tester

In the process of developing HPC software in the past, I have accumulated a lot of experience in debugging and testing. Although most of the time Iâ€™m testing C/C++ applications,  learning python testing and debugging may not be difficult for me.
