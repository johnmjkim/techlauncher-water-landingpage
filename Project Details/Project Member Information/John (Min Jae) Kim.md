Connect physical model to ML model

1. Team Management

I have experience as a team leader for professional practice 1 and 2 (PP1, PP2). Our group project requires prior knowledge (stakeholder analysis, PCM) of all those projects in PP1, 2. Our groups in PP1, 2 excelled on the performance and I all got HD grades for those projects.

I am also confident on using team management tools, setting teamwork infrastructure for development. Iâ€™ve done those during my structured programming and software construction course.

2. PhiFlow

I have undergraduate background on mechanical engineering and 3 years work experience on automotive company as a research engineer. So I am confident on connecting physical space with machine learning model.

3. Connect physical model to ML model

I am confident on Java, Python, MATLAB language for programming. Especially, I am capable on creating simulation environment as I have experience on MATLAB simulation.

I am also proficient on using python language as I took introduction to machine learning course last semester.
