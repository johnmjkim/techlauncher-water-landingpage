I would like to contribute to implementing PDEs and testing. Also I am open to help with team management.

Though I am more familiar with Java, I have some basic knowledge on python and I believe programing language will not be the barriar. I have a undergradute background of chemistry. I have taken the course intro to ml last semester and parallel system this semester and hopefully they would be some help more or less. And for sure I am also open to any other possible roles.
