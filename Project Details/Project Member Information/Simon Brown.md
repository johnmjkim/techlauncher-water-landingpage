# Simon Brown

I want to code stuff. I don’t mind what.

I’ve got some experience in Python, Machine Learning (not Neural Networks though), and Calculus. As well as experience with a lot of other imperative programming languages and systems. With that I feel like I’d be able to pick up wherever needs some focus.

I also have experience in UI and UX design if that ever comes up.
