Contribution preference:

- API implementation and Data processing:

I’m familiar with python and have taken basic courses on data science. With the experience on pandas library and other ML criteria, API implementation or data processing would not be difficult for me.

- High-performance Computing related:

With experience working on NCI computing clusters(HPC courses) and undergraduate working on computational chemistry, I’m quite familiar with remote environments, the job-submission system, and the automated data-generation process. But it relies on pre-existing core calculation program. I think it would help when we need to run code on super-computers.

I’m also interested in the numerical calculation part, but not good at it.
