Contribution preference:

- API development

I have no previous experience in API development, but I am confident with Python programming. I think API development is a very necessary skill, so I am willing to spend time learning this skill. And based on my python development experience, I think developing APIs will be challenging, but not overly difficult.

- Assistance in building physical simulation models (PyTorch Integration, Raw data operation)

I'm not good at PDE or ODE, so I can't help much with the physical side of things. I have experience in building deep neural networks on PyTorch. As well as experience in model tuning. In terms of data processing, I have experience using Pandas. I have finished Intro ML, SML, and Deep Learning courses, so I have some confidence in ML stuff. Thus, I think I can make some contribution on PyTorch Integration and Data Processing for the simulation model construction phase.
