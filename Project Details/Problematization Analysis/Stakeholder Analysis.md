Stakeholder Analysis

</br>

The position of each stakeholders are determined with criteria below :

- High power, highly interested people (Manage Closely): you must fully engage these people, and make the greatest efforts to satisfy them.

- High power, less interested people (Keep Satisfied): put enough work in with these people to keep them satisfied, but not so much that they become bored with your message.

- Low power, highly interested people (Keep Informed): adequately inform these people, and talk to them to ensure that no major issues are arising. People in this category can often be very helpful with the detail of your project.

- Low power, less interested people (Monitor): again, monitor these people, but don’t bore them with excessive communication.
