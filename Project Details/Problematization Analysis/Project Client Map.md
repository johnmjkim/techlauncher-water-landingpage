1.

How Might We : Data61 develop a neural network emulator of groundwater flow for faster and more efficient prediction

2.

Our client :

Our client is the Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence Future Science Platform within CSIRO’s Data61 Business Unit (Dan MacKinlay, Dan Pagandem, Petra Khunert).

What motivate them :

Their interest is in “Predicting and forecasting the dynamics of ocean currents, weather events, and dynamics of water and solute movement described by surface and groundwater hydrological models” (according to their [paper](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2021/files/NeurIPS_ML4PS_2021_8.pdf)). For such systems, inference of high-dimensional unobserved parameters is challenging because gradients must be estimated by finite difference, which rapidly becomes prohibitively expensive.

3.

What is the current operation of the business like? Business or organisational detail.



CSIRO is government funded, small teams

4.

What is currently working? What are the strengths of the business?

What are current weaknesses? What can be improved?



They have a small Neural Net working, they don’t have a way of generating lots of training data for more NNs.

5.

What environment do they operate in? What sector?

What are relevant statistics? What are the trends? What are others doing in this space?



They are working on Physics-informed Machine Learning

It’s a good topic in machine learning. Some teams are also working on this topic, like  “Deep Learning Method Based on Physics Informed Neural Network with Resnet Block for Solving Fluid Flow Problems“ or “Physics-informed machine learning“ in nature view(https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-021-00314-5?proof=t%2Btarget%253D ).

Research, Government,



6. Who do they currently see as their users/customer segments? Project question to keep in mind: are there other customer segments? Who are they? What drives them?



Group interested on groundwater prediction



7. What is/do they think is their current value proposition?

The emulator will reduce costs and time spent calculating.



8. What do you see as the gap? What does the client see as the gap? Discuss as needed to come to a new understanding
   What opportunities does this create?



Physics models are hard to be simulated, which requires great math skills

Discrepancy between real world and physical-simulation modeling. Our dataset or simulation modelling is using fast approximation, which may cause more gap between real world.
