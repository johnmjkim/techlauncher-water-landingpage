# Project Milestone and Timeline

## Deliverables

- Stage 1 (Semester 1, 2022) :

  - A PDE simulation model based on agreed software which has PDE solving capacity (e.g FeNICs, jax-cfd or PhiFlow)

  - Using the simulation model to generate a large amount of data (Approx. 100GB) which will be used in Stage 2

  - An API for PDE simulation model and dataset of simulations

- Stage 2 (2022, S2)

  - A deep neural network that accomplishes groundwater flow prediction with good results

  - The prediction of groundwater flow
