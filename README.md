## Goal

</br>

The main goal of our team is to predict groundwater flow in a faster and more efficient way by developing an emulator.

Because groundwater models are slow to run and ground truth data is expensive, we implement machine learning (ML) method to accomplish this goal.

**Our project aims to create :**

(1) Benchmark datasets for different Partial Differential Equations (PDE)

(2) Methods to facilitate better prediction given the data sets from stage 1

## Know your spaces

</br>

We are using following tools with specific purpose. Shortcut links of each tool can be found here.

||Tool|Purpose|
|:-:|:-:|:-|
|1|Confluence|- Project overview, description & landing page</br> - Project admin, plans, tasks & documents</br> - Set product requirements & project timeline</br> - Meeting notes & decision logs|
|2|Slack|- Communication|
|3|Trello|- Task, schedule managements</br> - Task allocation, member designation</br> - Progress status</br> - Progress visualization|
|4|Google Drive|- Shared folder for all resources|
|5|GitHub|- Project development repository|

</br>

We also have separate confluence spaces for specific projects as followings.

</br>

||Tool|Purpose|
|:-:|:-:|:-|
|1|Technical Documentation Space|Every technical, product documents created by the team</br> - Product specification</br> - Technical documentation|

</br>

## Know your pages
