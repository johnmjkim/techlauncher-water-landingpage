## Goal

</br>

The main goal of our team is to develop an emulator of groundwater flow for faster and more efficient prediction.

Because groundwater models are slow to run and ground truth data is expensive, we implement a machine learning (ML) method to accomplish this goal.

**Our project aims to create :**

(1) Benchmark datasets for different Partial Differential Equations (PDE)

(2) methods to facilitate better prediction given the data sets from stage 1

## Know your spaces

</br>

We are using following tools with specific purpose. Shortcut links of each tool can be found here.

||Tool|Purpose|
|:-:|:-:|:-|
|1|GitHub|- Project Landing page & audit</br> - Project development repository |
|2|Confluence|-Project internal collaborative tools</br> - Project overview, description</br>- Project admin, plans, tasks & documents</br> - Set product requirements & project timeline</br> - Meeting notes & decision logs|
|3|Slack|- Communication|
|4|Trello|- Task, schedule managements</br> - Task allocation, member designation</br> - Progress status</br> - Progress visualization|
|5|Google Drive|- Shared folder for all resources|


</br>

We also have separate confluence spaces for specific projects as followings.

</br>

||Tool|Purpose|
|:-:|:-:|:-|
|1|Technical Documentation Space|Every technical, product documents created by the team</br> - Product specification</br> - Technical documentation|

</br>

## Know your pages

</br>

Every admin documents - meeting notes, agendas, project plans, members information - created by the team must be stored here.
