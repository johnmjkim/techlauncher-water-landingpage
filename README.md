##  Goal

The main goal of our team is to predict groundwater flow faster and more efficient way by developing emulator. 

Because groundwater models are slow to run and ground truth data is expensive, we implement machine learning (ML) method to accomplish this goal. 

Our project aims to create : 

(1) Benchmark datasets for different Partial Differential Equations (PDE)

(2) methods to facilitate better preduction given the data sets from stage 1
