## Goal

</br>

The overarching goal is to develop methods for emulation for models that are characterised by Partial Differential Equations (PDE),  for faster and more efficient prediction. Groundwater models are slow to run and as ground truth data is expensive to acquire, the end goal is to use machine learning (ML) to develop a surrogate version that is faster to simulate from.  Prior to developing the methods, this project aims to construct a range of benchmark datasets for models underpinned by PDE, which then allow us to progress in a second phase of Techlauncher in the second semester, where the goal will focus more on the development of ML methods for emulation

## Know your spaces

</br>

We are using following tools with specific purpose. Shortcut links of each tool can be found here.

||Tool|Purpose|
|:-:|:-:|:-|
|1|GitHub|- Project Landing page & audit</br> - Project development repository |
|2|Confluence|-Project internal collaborative tools</br> - Project overview, description</br>- Project admin, plans, tasks & documents</br> - Set product requirements & project timeline</br> - Meeting notes & decision logs|
|3|Slack|- Communication|
|4|Trello|- Task, schedule managements</br> - Task allocation, member designation</br> - Progress status</br> - Progress visualization|
|5|Google Drive|- Shared folder for all resources|


</br>

We also have separate confluence spaces for specific projects as followings.

</br>

||Tool|Purpose|
|:-:|:-:|:-|
|1|Technical Documentation Space|Every technical, product documents created by the team</br> - Product specification</br> - Technical documentation|

</br>

## Know your pages

</br>

Every admin documents - meeting notes, agendas, project plans, members information - created by the team must be stored here.
