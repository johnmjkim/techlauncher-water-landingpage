## Purpose of the project

</br>

Predict groundwater flow (long term goal)

Generate benchmark datasets that allow new ML (Physics informed ML) methods to be evaluated.

Create dataset for re-use (about 100GB)

Make an API for data-using

Ground truth data is expensive

Groundwater models are slow to run. We develop ML methods to find a faster, more efficient way to predict groundwater using a surrogate version or what we call an emulator.

Think of this as a 2-stage project.  (1) Benchmark datasets for different PDEs; (2) Methods to facilitate better prediction given the datasets from stage 1.
